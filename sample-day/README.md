# Sample Day

To facilitate the discussion on what a typical day might look like, we will pull together, in rough form, a day's learning.

The purpose is not to create a finished product, but to engage in discovery and discussion through practice and experimentation.

## Day outline

 - standup (15m) apps share their progress, concerns, ask & offer help
 - big picture (20-30m) instructor-led interactive session on the big ideas for the day (setting the scene, setting up mental models, diagrams, etc)
 - deep dive (60 - 90m) three core skills they'll need, 5m vid or reading followed by a _tightly coupled_, simple exercise based on that skill
 - workshop:
   - PI (20-30m) 3 - 5 MCQs delivered live by the PDE in a PI framework to assess the deep dive and target and iron out any misunderstanding
   - activity (open ended) rich task, contex-based, existing codebase, pair or group, with support and extensions for those who need them
 - plenary (20m) discuss progress, talk about mindset, housekeeping, etc

## We want

 -[ ] slides for standup & big picture
 -[ ] vids or docs for deep dive
 -[ ] exercises for deep dive
 -[ ] MCQs for peer instruction
 -[ ] pm activity
 -[ ] extension materials

## Topic

# Mac

Installing sqlite on Mac is made easier if you use `brew`.

1. Make sure you have [brew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

1. Run `brew install sqlite` in a terminal.

1. Close and reopen the terminal, and run `sqlite3 --version` to make sure it is
   installed correctly.

That's it! You're ready to go.

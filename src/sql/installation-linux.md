# Linux

Installation on Linux (Ubuntu) should be relatively straightforward.

1. Open a terminal and run `sudo apt update`.

1. Run `sudo apt install sqlite` to install.

1. Close and reopen the terminal, and run `sqlite3 --version` to make sure it
   installed correctly.

That's it! You're good to go.

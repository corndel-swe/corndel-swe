# Introduction to SQL

## What is SQL?

SQL, at its heart, is a powerful language designed for managing and manipulating
relational databases. From its inception in the early 1970s at IBM, SQL has
evolved into a standard that underpins the vast majority of today's database
systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. It enables you to
extract, analyse, and process data, turning raw figures into actionable
insights.

## Tables

A SQL database is made up of tables. A table looks a lot like a spreadsheet:

`Table: users`

| id  | username       | access | verified | followers |
| :-: | -------------- | ------ | :------: | :-------: |
|  1  | EluskM         | admin  |    1     |  1987531  |
|  2  | BillGatekeeper | user   |    1     |  1200457  |
|  3  | JeffWho        | user   |    0     |  500124   |
|  4  | OprahWindey    | admin  |    1     |  1750322  |
|  5  | MarkZeeberg    | user   |    1     |  1600320  |

If you have worked with spreadsheets before, you'll feel quite at home with SQL.
Each row represents an entity, such as a user. Each column represents an
attribute, such as the user's access level. What SQL allows you to do is talk to
the tables in the database to extract _exactly_ the information you need.

## What can you do with SQL?

The applications of SQL are as diverse as they are impactful. Here are just a
few possibilities:

**Data Analysis and Reporting**: Delve into data to uncover trends, perform
statistical analyses, and generate reports that drive business strategies.

**Database Management**: Design, create, and maintain databases that are the
backbone of virtually all software applications today.

**Web Development**: Interact with databases behind websites to manage user
data, content, and transactions.

**Data Integration**: Merge data from disparate sources, ensuring information is
harmonised and accessible.

It's a skill that not only enhances your employability but also equips you with
a critical understanding of the digital world.

## Learning SQL

We'll begin by learning how to query data from an existsing database. Later,
we'll take a look at managing the database - creating new tables, modifying
tables, and so on.

There's plenty to learn so we'd better get going!

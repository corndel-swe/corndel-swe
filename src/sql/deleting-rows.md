# Deleting rows

Deleting rows from a table is a common task, whether you're cleaning up data,
removing outdated information, or managing records based on specific criteria.
However, wield this tool with cautionâ€”deletions are permanent (outside of
transactional rollbacks). Let's walk through how to safely and effectively use
the `DELETE` statement.

## Syntax

The `DELETE` statement removes one or more rows from a table based on a
condition. Its basic syntax is as follows:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

::: danger

Be aware that the `DELETE` statement will remove all rows which meet the
condition in the `WHERE` clause.

If you do not provide a `WHERE` clause it will simply **delete all the rows**.

It is a good idea to `SELECT` the rows first and verify that your `WHERE` clause
does what you intend.

## Examples

### Deleting a user

To delete a user based on their `id`, we would run

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 7;
```

### Deleting multiple rows

If you need to delete all bleets with at most `1` like, this is how to do it:

```sql
DELETE FROM bleets
WHERE likes <= 1;
```

## Deleting with a subquery

Let us suppose that we need to delete all bleets by users with fewer than `100`
followers (without deleting the users). We can do this by providing a subquery
in the `WHERE` clause.

```sql
DELETE FROM bleets
WHERE userId IN (
    SELECT id FROM users
    WHERE followers < 100
);
```

Subqueries can be used with other queries too, such as `UPDATE`.

## Try it

Since the database is reset after each query, don't worry about permanently
deleting data. With a real database, however, you should be very careful!

DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 7;

SELECT *
FROM users;

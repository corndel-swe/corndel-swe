# Semantic HTML

## Generic elements

When writing HTML, there are two elements which get used with great frequency:
`<div>` and `<span>`. They are very useful, but they do sometimes get overused.

For example, consider this:

```html
<div>
  <span>Reviews</span>
  <div>
    <div>
      <span>La La Land</span>
      <span>
        "La La Land" is a vibrant and emotional musical that celebrates the joy
        and pain of pursuing dreams in...
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The `<div>` and `<span>` elements don't convey any meaning about the content
they enclose. It means that screen readers (for partially sighted or blind
users) can't parse it propery, and search engines won't understand it either.

## Semantic elements

It is better to write _semantic HTML_, making full use of the different elements
available and conveying a rich amount of context along with the content.

```html
<main>
  <h1>Reviews</h1>
  <section>
    <article>
      <h2>La La Land</h2>
      <p>
        "La La Land" is a vibrant and emotional musical that celebrates the joy
        and pain of pursuing dreams in...
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
</main>
```

::: tip

`<div>` and `<span>` definitely have their place - when you do need to enclose
some content but don't want to affect the semantics of the page, they are the
correct elements to choose. You will still use them plenty, but always take a
second to ask whether there is a dedicated element for what you're trying to do.

## Common elements

Here's a list of the most common elements you'll see in a HTML document.

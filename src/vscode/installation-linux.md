# Linux

Follow the quick steps below, or head over to the
[official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux) for more
information.

1. Head over to the [downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
   download the package for your flavour of Linux (on Ubuntu, this is the `.deb`
   package).

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the location of the downloaded `.deb` file.
   This is probably `cd ~/Downloads`.

1. Run `sudo apt install ./<file>.deb`, replacing with the real filename of your
   download.

1. Close and reopen your terminal, then type `code --version` to make sure it
   has installed properly.

All done! Read on to learn more about using VS Code.

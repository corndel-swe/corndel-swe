# Mac

If you're using a Mac, the default terminal language is Zsh. Fortunately, Zsh is
highly interoperable with bash, and you should be able to follow everything in
the tech docs with no problems.

Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight, type "Terminal", and press Enter. You can
also find the Terminal in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder.

Pop open a terminal, type

```bash
echo "Hello, bash!"
```

and hit enter. You should see your message printed in the terminal.

# Setting up

## Vite

It is completely possible to set up a React project from scratch, but it is a
little bit of a hassle.

Most developers nowadays let a development environment take care of this for
them, and that's what we'll do.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a development framework which brings together
lots of tooling and configuration to make our lives easier.

## Initialising the project

Open your `Repos` directory (or wherever you store your projects), then run the command

```bash
npm create vite@latest 
```

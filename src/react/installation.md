# Installation

## Node

React is a JavaScript framework, and so in order to use it we need a JavaScript
runtime. When we are writing plain old JS for the front-end, that runtime is
already provided by the browser itself.

However, when developing React code, it doesn't run in the browser, it runs in a
separate runtime called [Node](https://nodejs.org/en). When we are ready to
deploy our app, the code gets bundled and transpiled so that it runs in the
browser.

In order to install Node and npm on your machine, follow our
[Node installation guide](/js/installation), and come back to continue when
you're ready.

## VS Code

Other editors are available, but VS Code has excellent support for React
development, so it's a great choice. We have a
[VS Code installation guide](/vscode/installation-windows) to help you get
going.

With Node and VS Code installed, we're ready to set up a React project.
